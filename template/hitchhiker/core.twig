{#
    This is used as the base template for most Rehike pages. Pages should
    extend this, rather than core/core.twig. This is used as a router for
    more specific page extension.

    Each core template provides a type of the YouTube layout.
        - core.twig provides appbar (aka Nirvana)
        - core_legacy.twig provides no-appbar (like hitchhiker in 2013)
